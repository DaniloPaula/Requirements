This repository aims to store the python language packages that I usually use to facilitate reinstallation after each Python / Anaconda update and command lines in Git Bash to remind me how to create repositories, etc.

To upload the updated repository after creating it:
1) git remote add origin /path/to/origin.git
2) git add .
3) git commit -m "initial commit"
4) git push origin master
