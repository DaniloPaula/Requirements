pip install -r D:\EPS\Requirements\reqs.txt --use-deprecated=legacy-resolver

--use-deprecated = legacy-resolver makes it possible to use the old conflict checking mechanism between packages,
which can save a lot of time

For each new package installed, I add it to the end of the reqs.txt file.
For example "pandas>=1.0.0" without quotes. With that he will always get the most current version of each package
